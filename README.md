# Asetto Corsa Fpv
Assetto Corsa fpv drone mod. \
I don't really know how to program, so if you see something wrong, please make a PR or open a issue.

# Setup
**Content Manager / Custom Shaders Patch is required**

1. Enable Free Camera | [Tutorial](https://www.reddit.com/r/assettocorsa/comments/anbgjt/how_to_enable_free_camera_mouse_look_in_assetto/)
2. Download or clone this repo and copy the apps folder in the Assetto Corsa folder
> C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\assettocorsa\
3. Enable the app
4. Check if the controller inputs work in Content Manager. You can change the order or invert them in the app settings page.
> Default: 1 = Throttle, 2 = Roll, 3 = Pitch, 4 = Yaw

5. Load in game and press F7.


# Todo / Ideas
- Accurate rates (betaflight, kiss, raceflight)
- Osd
- Video noise
